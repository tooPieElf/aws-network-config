hello, in this repo which launches all mt infrastructure, i have removed 
all existing keyname and ssh ports. Unless it means i should remove it from even the whole project, 
which shouldnt be a problem because its not part of this launch configuration.

the keyname left in the supportign structure isnt mine and it was there for generic purposes.
my main yml is this folder "project_starter"
